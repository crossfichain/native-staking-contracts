# CrossFi Native Staking System Documentation

## Overview

The CrossFi Native Staking system allows users to stake their XFI tokens with validators to earn rewards. The system supports two types of staking:

1. APR Staking - Direct staking with validators
2. APY Staking - Staking through a vault with automatic compounding

## System Components

### Core Contracts

- `NativeStakingManager` - Main entry point for user interactions
- `NativeStaking` (APR) - Handles direct validator staking
- `NativeStakingVault` (APY) - Manages APY staking with automatic compounding
- `UnifiedOracle` - Provides APR/APY rates and validator information
- `WXFI` - Wrapped XFI token for internal operations

### Key Parameters

- Minimum Stake: 50 XFI
- Minimum Unstake: 10 XFI
- Minimum Reward Claim: 1 XFI
- Unbonding Period: 21 days
- Initial Freeze Time: 30 days

## Staking Flows

### 1. APR Staking

APR staking allows users to stake directly with validators and earn rewards based on the validator's performance. The system now uses a split architecture to manage contract size.

![Stake APR Flow](/Users/valery/Projects/CrossFi/Native-staking/native-staking-contracts/docs/schemes/Stake%20APR%20Flow.png)

#### Steps to Stake APR

1. Connect wallet to the frontend
2. View available validators and their current APR rates
3. Select a validator and enter stake amount (minimum 50 XFI)
4. Approve the transaction to SplitNativeStakingManager
5. The manager handles wrapping native XFI to WXFI if needed
6. The manager delegates the stake to the APR contract
7. Events are emitted for tracking

### 2. APY Staking

APY staking provides automatic compounding of rewards through a vault system.

![Multiple Validator Stakes Flow](/Users/valery/Projects/CrossFi/Native-staking/native-staking-contracts/docs/schemes/Multiple%20Validator%20Stakes%20Flow.png)

#### Steps to Stake APY

1. Connect wallet to the frontend
2. View current APY rate
3. Enter stake amount (minimum 50 XFI)
4. Approve the transaction to SplitNativeStakingManager
5. The manager handles the deposit into the vault
6. Shares are minted to represent the user's stake
7. Events are emitted for tracking

## Reward Management

### Claiming APR Rewards

The reward claiming process has been enhanced with additional error handling:

![Claim Rewards Flow](/Users/valery/Projects/CrossFi/Native-staking/native-staking-contracts/docs/schemes/Claim%20Rewards%20Flow.png)

The updated flow:
1. Frontend queries the UnifiedOracle for claimable rewards
2. User initiates a claim transaction
3. SplitNativeStakingManager verifies rewards with the oracle
4. Oracle clears the user's claimable rewards
5. Manager transfers WXFI tokens to the user
6. Events are emitted with MPX-equivalent amounts for tracking

### APY Rewards

APY rewards are automatically compounded into the vault. Users can:
1. View their current share balance
2. Withdraw their shares at any time
3. See their current APY rate

## Unstaking Process

### APR Unstaking

The unstaking process now includes enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms:

![Unstake and Claim Flow](/Users/valery/Projects/CrossFi/Native-staking/native-staking-contracts/docs/schemes/Unstake%20and%20Claim%20Flow.png)

Updated flow:
1. User requests unstaking from a specific validator
2. SplitNativeStakingManager verifies the unstaking is not frozen
3. A requestUnstake call is made to the APR contract
4. The system tracks the unbonding period (21 days)
5. After the unbonding period, the user claims their unstaked tokens
6. The claim process includes try/catch blocks to handle potential errors
7. Proper balance checks ensure the user receives their tokens

### APY Unstaking

1. Request withdrawal from the vault
2. Wait for the unbonding period (21 days)
3. Claim the withdrawal

## Multiple Validator Support

The system supports staking with multiple validators simultaneously:

```plantuml
@startuml Multiple Validator Stakes Flow

## Integration Guide

### 1. APR Staking Flow

#### Staking Process

```solidity
// 1. User initiates staking
NativeStakingManager.stakeAPR(
    amount,      // Amount of XFI to stake (minimum 50 XFI)
    validatorId  // Validator ID (must start with 'mxva')
)

// 2. Backend monitors the event
event StakedAPR(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 xfiAmount,
    uint256 mpxAmount,
    string validator,
    bool success,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)

// 3. Backend processes the stake
// - Validates validator status
// - Updates user's stake records
// - Monitors validator performance
```

#### Unstaking Process

```solidity
// 1. User initiates unstaking
uint256 requestId = NativeStakingManager.unstakeAPR(
    amount,      // Amount to unstake (minimum 10 XFI)
    validatorId  // Validator ID
)

// 2. Backend monitors the event
event UnstakedAPR(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 xfiAmount,
    uint256 mpxAmount,
    string validator,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)

// 3. Backend processes the unstake request
// - Validates unbonding period
// - Updates validator status
// - Calls fulfillRequest when complete

// 4. User claims unstaked tokens after unbonding period
uint256 amount = NativeStakingManager.claimUnstakeAPR(requestId)
```

#### Reward Claiming Process

```solidity
// 1. User claims rewards
uint256 amount = NativeStakingManager.claimRewardsAPR()

// 2. Backend monitors the event
event RewardsClaimedAPR(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 xfiAmount,
    uint256 mpxAmount,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)

// 3. Backend processes the claim
// - Updates reward records
// - Updates user's last claim time
```

### 2. APY Staking Flow

#### Staking Process

```solidity
// 1. User stakes in APY vault
uint256 shares = NativeStakingManager.stakeAPY(
    amount  // Amount of XFI to stake (minimum 50 XFI)
)

// 2. Backend monitors the event
event StakedAPY(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 xfiAmount,
    uint256 mpxAmount,
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)

// 3. Backend processes the stake
// - Updates user's share balance
// - Monitors APY rate
```

#### Withdrawal Process

```solidity
// 1. User requests withdrawal
uint256 requestId = NativeStakingManager.withdrawAPY(
    shares  // Amount of vault shares to withdraw
)

// 2. Backend monitors the events
event WithdrawnAPY(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 xfiAssets,
    uint256 mpxAssets,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)
// OR
event WithdrawalRequestedAPY(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 xfiAssets,
    uint256 mpxAssets,
    uint256 indexed requestId
)

// 3. If immediate withdrawal:
// - User receives XFI immediately
// - Backend updates records

// 4. If delayed withdrawal:
// - Wait for unbonding period (21 days)
// - User claims withdrawal
uint256 assets = NativeStakingManager.claimWithdrawalAPY(requestId)
```

### 3. Backend Integration Steps

1. **Event Monitoring**
   ```solidity
   // Monitor all relevant events
   StakedAPR
   UnstakedAPR
   RewardsClaimedAPR
   StakedAPY
   WithdrawnAPY
   WithdrawalRequestedAPY
   ```

2. **Request Processing**
   ```solidity
   // Process pending requests
   NativeStakingManager.fulfillRequest(
       requestId,
       status,    // FULFILLED or FAILED
       reason     // Optional reason for failure
   )
   ```

3. **Validator Monitoring**
   ```solidity
   // Check validator status
   bool isActive = UnifiedOracle.isValidatorActive(validatorId)
   
   // Get validator APR
   uint256 apr = UnifiedOracle.getValidatorAPR(validatorId)
   ```

4. **Reward Tracking**
   ```solidity
   // Get user's claimable rewards
   uint256 rewards = UnifiedOracle.getUserClaimableRewards(userAddress)
   
   // Clear rewards after claiming
   UnifiedOracle.clearUserClaimableRewards(userAddress)
   ```

### 4. Frontend Integration Steps

1. **Connect to Contracts**
   ```javascript
   const manager = new ethers.Contract(
     "0xbda4FCbd54594c482052f8F6212Df471037bD7ef",
     NativeStakingManagerABI,
     provider
   );
   ```

2. **APR Staking**
   ```javascript
   // Stake XFI
   await manager.stakeAPR(amount, validatorId, { value: amount });
   
   // Unstake XFI
   const requestId = await manager.unstakeAPR(amount, validatorId);
   
   // Claim rewards
   await manager.claimRewardsAPR();
   ```

3. **APY Staking**
   ```javascript
   // Stake XFI
   const shares = await manager.stakeAPY(amount, { value: amount });
   
   // Withdraw XFI
   const requestId = await manager.withdrawAPY(shares);
   
   // Claim withdrawal
   await manager.claimWithdrawalAPY(requestId);
   ```

4. **Query User Data**
   ```javascript
   // Get user stakes
   const stakes = await manager.getUserStakes(userAddress);
   
   // Get pending unstake requests
   const requests = await manager.getUserUnstakeRequests(userAddress);
   
   // Get total staked amount
   const totalStaked = await manager.getTotalStaked(userAddress);
   ```

## Implementation Details

### claimUnstakeAPR Function

```solidity
function claimUnstakeAPR(address validator, uint256 requestId) external whenUnstakeNotFrozen {
    try aprValidatorsData[validator].getRequestInfo(requestId) returns (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 stakedAt,
        uint256 requestedAt,
        NftRewardsDetails memory rewardsDetails,
        StakeTier stakeTier
    ) {
        // Process with valid request info
        require(
            block.timestamp >= requestedAt + unstakeLockDuration,
            "UnstakingManager: unbonding period has not elapsed"
        );
        
        aprValidatorsData[validator].clearRequest(requestId);
        aprStake[msg.sender][validator].unstakePending -= amount;
        
        // Transfer tokens to user
        IERC20(wxfiToken).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        
        emit UnstakeClaimed(msg.sender, validator, amount, requestId);
    } catch {
        // Fallback mechanism for failed request retrieval
        // Check the global record if the request exists
        UnstakeRequest storage request = unstakeRequests[msg.sender][validator][requestId];
        require(request.amount > 0, "UnstakingManager: invalid request id");
        require(
            block.timestamp >= request.requestedAt + unstakeLockDuration,
            "UnstakingManager: unbonding period has not elapsed"
        );
        
        uint256 amount = request.amount;
        delete unstakeRequests[msg.sender][validator][requestId];
        aprStake[msg.sender][validator].unstakePending -= amount;
        
        // Transfer tokens to user
        IERC20(wxfiToken).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        
        emit UnstakeClaimed(msg.sender, validator, amount, requestId);
    }
}
```

### claimRewardsAPRNative Function

```solidity
function claimRewardsAPRNative() external {
    ensureOracleFreshness();
    
    uint256 claimableRewards = unifiedOracle.getUserClaimableRewards(msg.sender);
    require(claimableRewards > 0, "StakingManager: no rewards to claim");
    
    // Clear user rewards in oracle
    uint256 xfiPrice = diaOracle.getValue(XFI_CURRENCY_KEY);
    unifiedOracle.clearClaimableRewards(msg.sender, claimableRewards, xfiPrice);
    
    // For production, we would withdraw WXFI
    // require(IWXFI(wxfiToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= claimableRewards, "StakingManager: not enough WXFI balance");
    // IWXFI(wxfiToken).withdraw(claimableRewards);
    
    // For testing, we assume the contract has the necessary ETH
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: claimableRewards}("");
    require(success, "StakingManager: failed to send ETH");
    
    emit RewardsClaimedAPR(msg.sender, claimableRewards);
}
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **MockWXFI Interaction**: In test environments, the MockWXFI contract doesn't properly implement the withdraw function, requiring a direct ETH transfer as a workaround. In production, the actual WXFI contract will be used, which correctly implements withdraw functionality.

2. **Compiler Warnings**: There are several compiler warnings about unused parameters and state mutability that should be addressed in future updates.

3. **Upgradeability Concerns**: The UUPS pattern requires careful implementation of the `_authorizeUpgrade` function to prevent unauthorized upgrades.
